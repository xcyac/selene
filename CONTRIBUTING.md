# How to contribute

Before implementing your ideas, it is recommended first to create a corresponding issue and discuss the plan to be approved;)
Also consider first to help with issues marked with help_needed label ;)

1. Find an existing relevant issue or add a new one to this project.
2. Discuss its need and possible implementation. And once approved...
3. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) the [project](https://github.com/yashaka/selene/fork).
4. Clone your fork of the project `git clone https://github.com/[my-github-username]/selene.git`
5. Install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org) via `pip install poetry`
6. `cd selene`
7. `poetry install`
8. `poetry shell`
9. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
10. Stage appropriate changes (via `git add`),
    
    and commit: `git commit -am "[#$ISSUE_NUMBER] $COMMIT_MESSAGE"`, 
    
    (example: `git commit -am "[#321] TEST: improve tests structure"`)
    
    where
    - ISSUE_NUMBER is the number of issue this commit relates to
    - COMMIT_MESSAGE is... 
    
    ```
    <type>: <subject>
    
    <body>
    ```
    
    where
    - `<type>` is one of:
      - NEW: (new feature for the user, not a new feature for build script)
      - FIX: (bug fix for the user, not a fix to a build script)
      - DOCS: (changes to the documentation)
      - STYLE: (formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no production code change)
      - REFACTOR: (refactoring production code, eg. renaming a variable)
      - TEST: (adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change)
      - CHORE: (updating build tasks etc; no production code change)
    - `<subject>`
      - summary of "what and why?" (not "how?")
      - is in present tense, 
        in the imperative (e.g. `change` over `changes` or `changed`), 
        <= 50 symbols
      - has no period in the end
    - `<body>`
      - More detailed explanatory text if needed. Wrapped to 72 characters. 
      - Focused on what and why over how. 
      - Separated from `<subject>` with a blank line
      - Further paragraphs come after blank lines.
      - Bullet points are okay, too.
      - Typically, a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, followed by a
  single space. Use a hanging indent.

# Code Conventions
We follow the principles of consistency and readability.
Code-style is controlled by few linter jobs in GitHub Actions.

1. [Pycodestyle](https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle)
2. [Pylint](https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint)
3. [Black](https://github.com/psf/black)

### Pycodestyle 
- protects the code from violations of agreed rules.
- ignores E402,E731 rules for now.

### Pycodestyle-full-report
- prints a full report of pycodestyle rule violations, including not agreed yet.

### Pylint
- protects the code from violations of agreed rules.
- lints all agreed rules configured in [.pylintrc](https://github.com/yashaka/selene/blob/master/.pylintrc).
- ignores list of rules which are not agreed yet [.pylint-disabled-rules](https://github.com/yashaka/selene/blob/master/.pylint-disabled-rules). 

### Pylint-full-report
- lints all agreed rules configured in [.pylintrc](https://github.com/yashaka/selene/blob/master/.pylintrc)
- prints a full report of pylint rule violations, including not agreed yet.

### Black 
- lints default black rules except "string normalization".

# Release process
First make sure you described release notes in CHANGELOG.md.
## Automatically

1. Create new release on GitHub.
2. Choose new tag or take not released yet.
   Name it without `v` prefix, like: `1.0.1`, `2.0.0a39`
3. Set "release title" to same value as tag name
   (in order to fully render at Releases section on main github project page,
   and be consistent with other common github projects)
4. Describe release notes.
   Give it a short summary as `# <Heading Summary>`
   Provide details (usually copied from CHANGELOG) 
   - if they are not same as summary ;)
5. Select pre-release checkbox if not stable.
   (Currently the 2.0.0a* alpha versions can also be marked as stable)
6. Publish the release on GitHub.

Then GitHub action will automatically build and publish release to pypi with selected tag automatically. Also it will commit the tag semver into `__init__.py` and `pyproject.toml` before building if it has not been there yet.

## Old fashion manually (only if GitHub Actions CI is not available)
1. bump version via `bash .run/bump_version.sh x.x.x`
2. build via `bash .run/build.sh`
3. publish via `bash .run/publish.sh`

or

`bash .run/bump_build_publish.sh x.x.x`

or if you want to control all by yourself

1. manually bump version in `pyproject.toml` and `selene/__init.py:__version__`
2. poetry publish --build

Also don't forget to push a tag and describe release notes on GitHub! (If GitHub Actions works then publish job will fail because same version had already been published on pypi.org)
